      <h2>1) PROBLEM</h2>
      <p>The world does not have an ambition shortage. It has an execution shortage.</p>
      <p>
        People already know what they want: get fit, transition careers, build side income,
        learn new skills, and complete meaningful life goals. What fails is daily conversion
        from intention into action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most productivity products stop at planning and tracking. They assume users can self-plan
        perfectly, self-motivate consistently, and self-recover quickly after misses.
        Real behavior does not work that way. Friction compounds. Momentum breaks. Restart gets harder.
      </p>
      <div class="highlight">
        Sparcd treats follow-through as a system design problem, not a motivation problem.
      </div>

      <h2>2) TARGET AUDIENCE</h2>
      <p>
        Sparcd is built for high-intent users with inconsistent execution. The initial wedge is women
        in Gabby's community, where we observed a clear pattern: strong ambition, clear goals,
        and a missing daily execution layer.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary user profile:</strong> motivated adults who feel overwhelmed when goals become operational.</li>
        <li><strong>Behavior profile:</strong> high aspiration, uneven consistency, repeated restart cycles.</li>
        <li><strong>Core use cases:</strong> fitness, upskilling, career transitions, travel planning, and habit formation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Long-term expansion is broad: any segment where the bottleneck is execution friction rather than idea generation.
      </p>

      <h2>How Sparcd Solves This</h2>
      <p>
        Sparcd is an AI-powered execution layer that transforms goals into a personalized, adaptive system users can sustain.
        Instead of static plans, users get structured journeys with milestone logic and daily actions sized for completion.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Micro-action design:</strong> tiny, clear actions reduce activation energy and increase daily completion probability.</li>
        <li><strong>Persona personalization:</strong> pacing and framing adapt to user style (Explorer, Perfectionist, People Pleaser, Overthinker, Sprinter, Dreamer).</li>
        <li><strong>Two-phase planning engine:</strong> goal analysis followed by milestone-based journey generation for stronger structure and relevance.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive recovery:</strong> when users skip or stall, upcoming tasks are regenerated at lower friction instead of leaving users stuck.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement loops:</strong> celebration, streaks, and visible progress strengthen consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Action Links:</strong> select tasks include direct links to trusted external resources so users can execute immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Grounded guidance:</strong> recommendations are grounded to real-world resources, reducing vague AI output.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Product thesis: adherence is a design outcome. If the next step is clear, small, personalized,
        and rewarding, users move from occasional motivation to compounding execution.
      </p>

      <h2>3) MONETIZATION STRATEGY</h2>
      <p>
        Sparcd uses a freemium subscription model with a clear value ladder from utility to outcomes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Free tier:</strong> core planning, daily actions, baseline reminders, and progress tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Pro tier:</strong> deeper personalization, optimized notification timing, richer guidance, and advanced adaptive capabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Monetization is implemented through RevenueCat with entitlement-based backend gating and native mobile purchase flows.
        This enables fast packaging/price iteration while preserving deterministic feature access.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users upgrade for one reason: better follow-through outcomes. The paid tier improves consistency,
        reduces restart friction, and increases confidence that goals actually move forward each day.
      </p>

      <h2>Monetization Logic</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear value ladder:</strong> free builds habit, Pro improves results.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily habit loop:</strong> high-frequency engagement supports retention and subscription durability.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization flywheel:</strong> more usage improves adaptation quality and perceived paid value.</li>
        <li><strong>Category expansion:</strong> the same execution engine scales across health, career, learning, and planning.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="highlight">
        Strategic direction: build the default execution platform for personal goals,
        where AI is measured by real-world follow-through, not content generation alone.
