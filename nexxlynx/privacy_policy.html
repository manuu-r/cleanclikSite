        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>
            This privacy policy applies to the nexxlynx app (hereby referred to
            as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by MaybeCoded
            (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a free service. This
            service is intended for use "AS IS".
        </p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <p>
            The Application collects information when you download and use it.
            This information may include information such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
            <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
            <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The Application requires access to certain device features to
            provide its core functionality. This access is used in the following
            ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Camera:</strong> The Service Provider requires access to
                your device's camera to enable video calling features. The
                camera is only activated with your explicit action and the video
                stream is not stored or used for any purpose other than direct
                communication.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO):</strong> Access to the
                microphone is necessary for voice and video calls. Audio is
                transmitted for real-time communication and is not recorded or
                stored by the Service Provider.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Storage (READ/WRITE):</strong> The application needs
                access to your device's storage to allow you to send, receive,
                and save media files such as photos and documents. The
                Application will only access files that you explicitly select to
                share.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The Service Provider may use the information you provide to contact
            you from time to time with important information and required
            notices.
        </p>

        <p>
            For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service
            Provider may require you to provide certain personally identifiable
            information. The information that the Service Provider requests will
            be retained and used as described in this privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Third Party Access</h2>

        <p>
            Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to
            external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the
            Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your
            information with third parties in the ways that are described in
            this privacy statement.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically
            Collected Information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or
                similar legal process;
            </li>
            <li>
                when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
                protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of
                others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
            </li>
            <li>
                with their trusted services providers who work on their behalf,
                do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to
                them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this
                privacy statement.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>

        <p>
            You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily
            by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as
            may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile
            application marketplace or network.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>

        <p>
            The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as
            you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. If
            you'd like to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via
            the Application, please contact us at dev@maybecoded.com and we will
            respond in a reasonable time.
        </p>

        <h2>Children</h2>

        <p>
            The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly
            solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from children. The Service Provider
            encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable
            information through the Application and/or Services. The Service
            Provider encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their
            children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by
            instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable
            information through the Application and/or Services without their
            permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided
            personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through
            the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider
            at dev@maybecoded.com so that we will be able to take the necessary
            actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the
            processing of your personally identifiable information in your
            country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to
            do so on your behalf).
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>

        <p>
            The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the
            confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides
            physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect
            information the Service Provider processes and maintains.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.
            The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy
            Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are
            advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as
            continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
        </p>

        <p class="effective-date">
            This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-12-03
        </p>

        <h2>Your Consent</h2>

        <p>
            By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of
            your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as
            amended by us.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
