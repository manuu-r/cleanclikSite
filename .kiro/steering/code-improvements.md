# Code Improvement Guidelines

## File Creation Policy

**NEVER create new files when asked for improvements.** Always work with existing files and enhance them.

### When Asked for Improvements:
1. **Analyze existing code** to understand current implementation
2. **Modify existing files** to add improvements
3. **Enhance existing services** rather than creating new ones
4. **Update existing classes** with better algorithms
5. **Refactor existing methods** for better performance

### Avoid Creating:
- New service files when existing services can be enhanced
- New utility files when existing utilities can be extended
- New model files when existing models can be improved
- Duplicate functionality in separate files

### Instead:
- Add methods to existing services
- Enhance existing algorithms
- Improve existing data structures
- Optimize existing implementations
- Add features to existing classes

## Implementation Approach

### For Performance Improvements:
- Optimize existing algorithms
- Add caching to existing services
- Improve existing data processing
- Enhance existing filtering logic

### For Feature Enhancements:
- Extend existing service interfaces
- Add methods to existing classes
- Improve existing detection logic
- Enhance existing analysis capabilities

### For Bug Fixes:
- Fix issues in existing code
- Improve existing error handling
- Enhance existing validation
- Optimize existing resource management

This ensures code remains organized, maintainable, and follows the established architecture patterns.
